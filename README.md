**Dockerized WebApp + Telegram Bot for Remote Server Monitoring and Control**

Telegram Server Monitor is a fully containerized application that provides a web-based GUI and a Telegram bot to monitor and manage your Linux server. It delivers real-time notifications about SSH/SFTP access, system resource usage, internet connectivity, and Docker container management.
